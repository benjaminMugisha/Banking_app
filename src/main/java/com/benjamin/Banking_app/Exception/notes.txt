													EXCEPTION HANDLING
APIs must have exceptions handled properly for giving proper response back to client. so the client is well informed
about what error is happening and they don't get to know what's happening in our backend so security.
2 main annotations:  @RestControllerAdvice and @ExceptionHandler
@RestControllerAdvice or @ControllerAdvice is used to globally handle all exceptions to all controllers
@ExceptionHandler handles specific annotation and sends custom response back to the client.

@RestControllerAdvice or @ControllerAdvice :
If your app is a REST API only: Use @RestControllerAdvice.
If your app serves both web pages and APIs: Use @ControllerAdvice for flexibility. Use @ResponseBody in specific handlers for JSON responses.
If you only need JSON or XML responses everywhere: Use @RestControllerAdvice for simplicity.
